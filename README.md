# Bluehook

Webhooks for Bluesky! This consists of a Rust worker which handles the firehose and a webapp that handles adding users to the database and telling the worker when to grab new data from the database.

Documentation is a work in progress, but [this example here is likely very useful to you!](https://github.com/IAmJSD/bluehook-example/blob/main/app/api/bluesky/route.ts)
